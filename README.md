Theme 'Emulga Box' released by Emulga based from original 'recalbox-next’ theme
For use with EmulationStation (http://www.emulationstation.org/)

We’re proud to present you the new official Emulga Box theme. It’s been a long time we’ve wanted to make a clean theme so you could browse your collection in style! Beginning with an introductory video which covers iconic video game characters. With the new theme customizer functionality, you can now choose between 5 different system views. Choose the help menu icons depending on the controller you’re using. Choose the system logos according to your country. New audio tracks have been added. We also remastered all audio tracks to have consistent audio level between system change. The theme is also fully compatible with any screens like CRT and smaller screens.
